# Create new feature that arranges meetingCollection in 8 hour day
# If meetingCollection cannot fit, let user know "No, can't fit"
# 2 kinds of meetingCollection: onsite/offsite
# onsite: can be back to back w/o gaps
# offsite: 	-30 min buffer on either end (travel time)
# 			    -can overlap off-site meetingCollection
# 			    -can extends past Start/End of Day
